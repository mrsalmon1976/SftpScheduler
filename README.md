SftpScheduler
==================

SftpScheduler is a web-based tool used to schedule SFTP jobs. It can be installed as a Windows service on a company server, and is accessed via a browser.  Hosts and jobs can be configured with schedules, and if you have access to an SMTP server, notifications can be configured for repeated job failures.
